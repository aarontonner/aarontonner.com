      <h2 class="cs-title">Calgary Web Design Prices</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        At this point you’re probably wondering, “how much does a website cost
        in Calgary?” Here I will briefly discuss how my
        <a href="/services">calgary web design</a> prices are justified. One of
        the first pieces of information I’d ask about is what your customer
        lifetime value is. Knowing what the total worth of a customer is to your
        business over the entire period of your relationship with them is an
        important metric to illustrate how I determine a suitable cost for your
        website to yield a positive return on your investment. My Calgary
        website design prices are determined by a few additional factors that we
        can dig deep into on a <a href="/contact">discovery call</a>: your
        business goals and challenges. The #1 focus when it comes to determining
        a Calgary website design cost is that it will result in a positive
        return on your investment. Every business is different which means
        website costs are always different. If you would like to discuss the
        above points to learn more about how I can help your business and to
        determine a web design investment level that aligns with your goals and
        budget, <a href="/contact">send me a message</a> to arrange a quick call

        Frequently Asked Calgary Website Design Questions
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        As a business owner, I understand that hiring a Calgary web designer can
        feel like a daunting task. You may have many questions and concerns
        about the process, pricing, your involvement, timelines, what you're
        responsible for, processes, and more. That's why I've put together this
        FAQ section to help answer some of the most common questions I receive
        from my clients before, during, and after building their website.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-flex-group">
      <div class="cs-button-group">
        <!--If you need to add another button, make sure to copy and paste from one of the buttons here and increment the data-filter value, so the next one would be data-filter="four", and so on-->
        <button class="cs-option" data-filter="one">Web Design</button>
        {#
        <button class="cs-option" data-filter="two">Website Development</button>
        <button class="cs-option" data-filter="three">Lifetime Edits</button> #}
      </div>
      <!--We need this wrapper so the absolutely positioned FAQ lists can be positioned to the top of it to so the animations don't amke it overlap the buttons group above it. We needed a wrapper div around it for the faq lists to be relatively positioned to in order to get the effect we wanted-->
      <div class="cs-wrapper">
        <!--If you add more FAQ's, copy and paste of of the .cs-faq-grop lists and increment the data-category to the next number. We have three right now, if you added a fourth you'd change it to data-category="four" to correspond to the new button you created in the .cs-button-group. The filter and category data attributes need to match so they can work together-->

            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              Typically, a new website will cost you somewhere between $4K and
              $50K, depending on the type of website and project size. However
              with my unique Calgary website design price package you can spend
              as little as $100 per month to get your website which includes
              lifetime edits!

              Easy answer: as involved as you want! Some clients love to sit
              back, relax, and enjoy the process of having their website built
              without lifting a finger. Other clients love having a say in the
              look, feel, and aesthetics of their new website design Calgary.
              Either way, my clients have always reported loving the process,
              while respecting the fact that I will provide insights to their
              suggestions in order to maintain a great user experience for their
              online customers.

              initially using their phones when looking for a new service
              provider or online products, it's imperative to the success of
              your website design that we consider the experience that these
              mobile-users will have while scrolling your website by creating a
              mobile-friendly (or mobile-responsive) layout.

              You bet. I'm a strong believer of a results-oriented approach to
              Calgary website design. Implementing even the most basics of
              <a href="/services/calgary-seo-services">SEO</a>
              in the initial build of your website will propel you far above
              your online competition. Why? Because a lot of <a href="/">Calgary web design
              companies</a> are just that - designers and developers without the
              time for <a href="/services/calgary-seo-services">SEO</a>. In fact, before even getting started on building
              your new website, I spend the first 2 weeks doing an SEO deep dive
              to analyze the best possible keywords to implement on your website
              while creating a content strategy on how to use those keywords in
              a way that maximizes your visibility and profit. If you want a
              more in-depth explanation on how I implement <a href="/services/calgary-seo-services">SEO on your Calgary
              website design, don't hesitate to

                Does the designer provide the content?
              </span>
            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              Most of the time, no. It's important that the industry-expert
              (you) craft the content in an informative and educational manner
              to provide maximum value for your customers. However, I understand
              that you have more important activities to spend your time on
              which is why I'm connected with multiple talented writers in
              various industries of expertise. Furthermore, if you have an
              existing website, I will restructure the content from there in a
              more engaging and <a href="/services/calgary-seo-services">SEO-friendly</a> way. If you have a website that
              already has a decent amount of content (1,000+ words), you are
              likely ranking on Google for some of your service or product
              keywords naturally. In that case, it's important that we consider
              this SEO data as we may be able to target "low hanging fruit"
              (keywords that are ranking somewhere between the 1st and 30th
              positions) for the best possible early-stage website design and
              SEO results.

              Your new website will be live within 10 days of <a href="/contact">signing up</a>! This
              is amazing because a typical Calgary
              <a href="/services">website design company</a> might spend the
              better part of 3 - 6 months building out your site - I can say
              this because that used to be me! Now, with a new way of providing
              custom websites to my clients, your website can be ready for sales
              in record time.

            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              Yes you will. Most of the <a href="/portfolio">websites I build</a> are set up in a way
              that enables my clients with access to a commonly used <a href="https://wpengine.com/resources/headless-cms-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">content
              management system</a> to add or edit website content (text and
              images). However, you will only have access to the content itself.
              The websites are custom-coded (yet hooked up to <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> for
              content management), so only with advanced HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript skills will you be able to edit the design and
              functionality of the website.

              Lucky for you, your web design subscription includes all hosting

              tell me horror stories about being "locked in" to extreme
              contracts where they were paying more than $600 CAD just to have
              their Calgary web design hosted! That's not how I roll, you will
              have 100% ownership of your website, domain, and hosting for the
              amount of time you're signed up.

              on your Calgary website design that you don't want to handle
              yourself, I'm just a <a href="/contact">click away</a> to make that happen. You'll get
              lifetime edits available to you with your new subscription - so
              you don't have to worry about using up hourly services.
