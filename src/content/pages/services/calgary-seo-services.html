            with you (like when your website traffic starts to soar) and pick
            you up when you're feeling discouraged (because I know how tough the
            online world can be). And if you're feeling stuck creatively, I'll
            be happy to brainstorm with you and come up with fresh ideas that
            will make your website pop. With me as your web designer, you'll
            feel confident and motivated to take on the digital world.

      <p class="cs-text">
        As a business owner, I understand that hiring a Calgary SEO
        <a href="/services">services</a>
        provider can feel like a daunting task. You may have many questions and
        concerns about the process, pricing, your involvement, timelines, what
        you're responsible for, processes, and much more. That's why I've put
        together this FAQ section to help answer some of the most common
        questions I receive from my clients before, during, and after signing up
        for an SEO campaign.

            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              SEO (Search engine optimization) is a marketing strategy used to
              get your website listed at the top of Google search results for
              search phrases related to your services or products. Calgary SEO
              is an effective way to create long-term visibility of what you
              have to offer for the customers looking for you online. The beauty
              of using SEO services in Calgary is that you don't need to
              convince your customers that your services or products are
              something they need, because they're already looking. What you DO
              have to accomplish, is communicate to your customers why they
              should hire YOU instead of your competitors.

                How much does Calgary SEO cost?
              </span>
            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              SEO Calgary service rates come in all shapes and sizes and you
              will typically be quoted between $1,000 - $10,000 per month
              depending on the marketing company you hire. However, taking
              advantage of my SEO Sprint offer enables your business an
              affordable SEO service at less than $950 as a one-time investment.
              When you're selecting an SEO package, it's important to note that
              different marketing companies use different SEO strategies - it's
              almost like a game of who can figure out what's going to be the
              most effective SEO tool to use based on your industry, and then to
              actually use that tool in the most strategic and creative way.
              This is why I created the SEO Sprint offer - I've selected the
              most effective SEO strategies I've used for my client's over the
              years and stuffed them into one juicy and low-cost Calgary SEO
              service package that aims to provide the best results in as short
              amount of time possible.

            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              You will typically see results from your SEO campaigns within 3 -
              6 months, however, it varies widely by industry and competition of
              the keywords targetted in your Calgary SEO campaigns. My client's
              have seen a massive boost in SEO rankings in as little time as 50
              days from launching their campaign - mainly due to effective
              market research to set the stage.

            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              My biased answer is yes, if you are a local business who has the
              capacity to take on more clients, and have the means to invest
              $950 into an SEO Sprint, this is something you should seriously
              consider. However, SEO is a marketing strategy that typically has
              better & faster results with an existing website that doesn't look
              like it's from 1995. If you're not quite there, feel free to

              <span class="cs-button-text"> Does SEO gaurantee results? </span>
            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              No, SEO certainly does not gaurantee any results. If you are
              talking to a Calgary SEO service provider promising a boost in
              your Google rankings, run! SEO is an ever-changing environment as
              Google makes frequent improvements to the algorithm in order to
              show customers on Google the best possible results for the search
              query. So, the reason SEO Calgary does not gaurantee results is
              because it's almost impossible to know what competition has
              planned for their next move in their own SEO campaign. It is
              important to keep up with your online competition to see what
              they've already done, and find ways to do it better - but when you
              are in the dark on their next move, you have to find ways to be
              one step ahead, which sometimes doesn't always prove to be the
              best method. This is why it's important to hire a SEO expert
              Calgary that's got their finger on the pulse!

                Why is Calgary SEO better than Google Ads?
              </span>
            </button>
            <p class="cs-item-p">
              This is a generalization that doesn't apply to every business. The
              nature of SEO provides long-term benefits which can be more
              cost-effective than Google Ads. With SEO, you are not paying for
              clicks, so depending on the industry, you might spend $500 for 5
              clicks on your Google Advertisement, compared to spending $500 on
              SEO, you're getting a month's worth of work that can result in a
              spike in rankings a few months down the road. I hope this gives
              you a better understanding of the difference in Calgary SEO vs.
              Ads - if you have any further questions please reach out!

            <p class="cs-item-p">
              You sure can! Anyone can do SEO - it's just a matter of knowing
              how to scan online competition for the successful keywords they're
              using, and finding better ways to implement them on your website,
              all while staying up to date with your other online profiles (link
              building, Google Business Profile, online reviews, etc). I'll have
              some DIY articles posted in the near future that can teach you

              In the U.S., the terms lawyer and attorney are often used
              interchangeably. A lawyer provides legal services such as giving
              legal advice, writing legal documents and providing policy counsel
              to governments. An attorney, on top of these things also holds a
              state or regional license to represent clients in a law court.
